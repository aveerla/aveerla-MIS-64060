## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }

library(reshape2)
library(gmodels)
library(caret)
library(ISLR)
library(e1071)

```

```{r}
#Read CSV file
UnivBank <-read.csv("UniversalBank.CSV")
```

```{r}
#Normalization
UnivBank$Personal.Loan<-factor(UnivBank$Personal.Loan)
UnivBank$Online<-factor(UnivBank$Online)
UnivBank$CreditCard<-factor(UnivBank$CreditCard)
```

```{r}
set.seed(10)
#Spliting data into training 60% and validation 40%
t.index <-sample(row.names(UnivBank), 0.6*dim(UnivBank)[1])
validt.index <- setdiff(row.names(UnivBank), t.index)
t.df <- UnivBank[t.index, ]
validt.df <- UnivBank[validt.index, ]
train <- UnivBank[t.index,]
validtest <- UnivBank[t.index, ]
```

#A Create a pivot table for the training data with Online as a column variable, CC as a row variable, and Loan as a secondary row variable. The values inside the table should convey the count. In R use functions melt() and cast(), or function table(). In Python, use panda dataframe methods melt() and pivot().
```{r}
melt.bank <- melt(train, id=c("CreditCard", "Personal.Loan"),variable="Online")
cast.bank <- dcast(melt.bank,CreditCard+Personal.Loan~Online)
cast.bank[,c(1:2,14)]

```

#B Consider the task of classifying a customer who owns a bank credit card and is actively using online banking services. Looking at the pivot table, what is the probability that this customer will accept the loan offer? [This is the probability of loan acceptance (Loan = 1) conditional on having a bank credit card (CC = 1) and being an active user of online banking services (Online = 1)].
```{r}
x= table(train[,c(10,13,14)])
y<-as.data.frame(x)
y
```
#C Create two separate pivot tables for the training data. One will have Loan (rows) as a function of Online (columns) and the other will have Loan (rows) as a function of CC.
#Creating pivot table for Loan (rows) as a function of Online (columns)
```{r}
table(train[,c(10,13)])
```
#Creating pivot table for Loan (rows) as a function of CC
```{r}
table(train[,c(10,14)])
```
#D Compute the following quantities [P(A | B) means “the probability ofA given B”]: i. P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) (the proportion of credit card holders among the loan acceptors) ii. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1) iii. P(Loan = 1) (the proportion of loan acceptors) iv. P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0) v. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0) vi. P(Loan = 0)
```{r}
#i P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1)
P1 <-table(train[,c(14,10)])
S1<- P1[2,2]/(P1[2,2]+P1[1,2])
S1
```
#ii P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1)
```{r}
P2 <- table(train[, c(13,10)])
S2 <- P2[2,2]/(P2[2,2]+P2[1,2])
S2
```
#iii P(Loan = 1)
```{r}
P3<-table(train[,10])
S3<-P3[2]/(P3[2]+P3[1])
S3
P3
```
#iv P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0)
```{r}
P4<-table(train[,c(14,10)])
S4<-P4[2,1]/(P4[2,1]+P4[1,1])
S4
```
#v P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0)
```{r}
P5<-table(train[,c(13,10)])
S5<-P5[2,1]/(P5[2,1]+P5[1,1])
S5
```
#vi P(Loan = 0)
```{r}
P6<-table(train[,10])
S6<-P6[1]/(P6[1]+P6[2])
S6

```
#E Use the quantities computed above to compute the naive Bayes probability P(Loan = 1 | CC= 1, Online = 1).
#NaiveBayesProbability= (S1*S2*S3)/[(S1*S2*S3)+(S4*S5*S6)]
#0.01849491/(0.01849491+0.15736368)=0.1051692

#F  Compare this value with the one obtained from the pivot table in (B). Which is a more accurate estimate?

#The value we got from pivot table is 0.092831 and the naive bayes is 0.1051692 and are almost similar. Pivot table value is more accurate. 

#G Which of the entries in this table are needed for computing P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1)? Run naive Bayes on the data. Examine the model output on training data, and find the entry that corresponds to P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1). Compare this to the number you obtained in (E).

#Naive Bayes on training data
```{r}
table(train[,c(10,13:14)])
train_Naive<-train[,c(10,13:14)]
UnivBank_NB<-naiveBayes(Personal.Loan~.,data = train_Naive)
UnivBank_NB
```
#Value obtained is 0.0983393 after running Naive bayes on data where as value from E is 0.1051692 which is almost similar. 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
