## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }

library(factoextra)
#Reading CSV file into Pharma variable
Pharma <- read.csv("Pharmaceuticals.csv")
head(Pharma)
#Taking the quantitative variables (1-9) to cluster 21 firms
Pharma1<-Pharma[,3:11]
head(Pharma1)
#here, scaling quantitative variables
Pharma2<-scale(Pharma1)
#we use two methods to calculate K value
#Calculating K value using Elbow method
fviz_nbclust(Pharma2, kmeans, method = "wss") + geom_vline(xintercept = 2, linetype = 5) + labs(subtitle = "Elbow Method")
#Calculating K value using Silhoutte method
fviz_nbclust(Pharma2, kmeans, method = "silhouette") + labs(subtitle = "Silhouette Method")
set.seed(1)
k5<-kmeans(Pharma2, centers = 2, nstart = 25)
k5$centers
#Visualizing clusters
fviz_cluster(k5, data=Pharma2)
fit<-kmeans(Pharma2,2)
#Getting mean values of quantitative variables
aggregate(Pharma2, by=list(fit$cluster), FUN=mean)
Pharma3<-data.frame(Pharma2, fit$cluster)
Pharma3
library(cluster)
#Visualizing data
clusplot(Pharma2, fit$cluster, color= TRUE, shades=TRUE, labels=2, lines=0)


#b) Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters.
#Cluster 1 - 2, 3, 5,6,8, 9,12,14,18,20 
#Cluster 2 -  1, 4,7,10,11,13,15,16,17,19, 21
#Observing mean values of numerical variables
#Cluster 1 has low Market_Cap, high Beta, high PE_Ratio, low ROE, low ROA, low Asset_Turnover, high leverage, high Rev_Growth low Net_PRofit_Margin
#Cluster 2 has high Market_Cap, low Beta, low PE_Ratio, high ROE, high ROA,high Asset_Turnover, low leverage, low Rev_Growth, high Net_Profit_Margin



# c) Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in forming the clusters) 

#Cluster 1 has mostly Moderate Buy recommendation 
#Cluster 2 has HOld recommendation 

# d) Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset. 

#Cluster 1 - low capped companies
#Cluster 2 - high market capped companies
